# QUTy-Development-Board-Project

CAB202 A2 -  Microcontroller project

This microcontroller project is based off the QUTy controller. Documentation for it can be found here:
https://cab202.github.io/quty/

The project aims to create an interactive sound and light sequencer via:
* Follow a sequence of predetermiend steps to:
  * Play tones via the buzzer
  * Set the brightness of the 7-segment display for specific and precise intervals of time.
* Interact with a user via:
  * Pushbutton and potentiometer inputs
  * Control of the 7-segment dispaly to allow a user to control the sequencer.
* Provide a UART-based serial command interface for:
  * Control of the sequencer
  * Testing sequencer core functions.
